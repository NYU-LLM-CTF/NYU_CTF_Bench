# BLOX 1 

**Description**: We found an old arcade machine lying around, manufactured by the RET2 Corporation. Their devs are notorious for hiding backdoors and easter eggs in their games, [care to take a peek?](https://wargames.ret2.systems/962c162fa1d2ea626d36/csaw_2020)

(NOTE: The WarGames site itself is not in scope, just the Blox Game. If you do find a security issue on the site, feel free to send it to us at support(at)ret2.io)

**Author's note** This chal is a tetris clone that is running on the WarGames site. User's have to reverse the binary for the "cheat codes" which can be activated by putting blocks in a certain shape on the screen
